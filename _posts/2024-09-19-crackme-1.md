The crackme1 executable file is available at [crackme1.rar](https://github.com/allsaint/allsaint.github.io/tree/main/_crackmes/crackme1.rar) archive.

1. The crackme calculates the hex sum of ascii characters of each block and finds the arithmetic mean for all blocks. for example
> 5127-7215-5127-7215 -> F
> 1234-4321-1234-4321 -> A
2. Each element of the block must be a digit from 0 to 9.
3. The sum of each block must not be equal to the arithmetic mean.
4. Next, the comparison of blocks: 2 blocks with 1, 3 with 2, 4 with 3.
5. The values of even and odd blocks should not be equal.
